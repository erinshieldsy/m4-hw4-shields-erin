        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Lauren Daigle was born on September 9, 1991, and is a singer and composer of Christian music. She was born in Lafayette, Louisiana, United States. Her first musical influences came from zydeco, blues, and Cajun music. From an early age, she became interested in singing. She had to be out of school for several months after contracting infectious mononucleosis, so she devoted herself completely to singing. After finishing her studies, she did missionary work in Brazil and then entered Louisiana State University for the Study of Children and Families. After joining the LSU choir and continuing to progress in her music career she received a contract in 2013 from Centricity Music. Lauren Daigle is now one of the most successful and renowned Christian artists. She has received two Grammy Awards, seven GMA Dove Awards, five Billboard Music Awards, two American Music Awards, and has had four No. 1 singles on both the Billboard Christian Airplay and Hot Christian Songs chart.</p>
